# Design Patterns

## Overview

Design patterns are general reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They represent best
practices to solve certain recurring design problems and provide a way to communicate efficient solutions among software
developers.

## Types of Design Patterns

- Creational: [ðŸ”—](./src/creational)
    - Singleton [ðŸ”—](./src/creational/singleton)
    - Factory/Factory Method [ðŸ”—](./src/creational/factorymethod)
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder  [ðŸ”—](./src/creational/builder)
    - Prototype  [ðŸ”—](./src/creational/prototype)
- Structural:  [ðŸ”—](./src/structural)
    - Adapter  [ðŸ”—](./src/structural/adapter)
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Facade
    - Flyweight
    - Proxy
- Behavioral: [ðŸ”—](./src/behavioral)
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Command
    - Interpreter
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - Observer [ðŸ”—](./src/behavioral/observer)
    - State [ðŸ”—](./src/behavioral/state)
    - Strategy [ðŸ”—](./src/behavioral/strategy)
    - Template Method
    - Visitor

## Usage

Each design pattern addresses a specific problem and provides a well-defined solution. They help in creating software
that is flexible, maintainable, and scalable.
Refer to the specific pattern's documentation for detailed information on its implementation and use cases.

## Conclusion

Design patterns provide standardized solutions to recurring design problems in software development. Creational patterns
deal with object creation, structural patterns focus on class composition, and behavioral patterns address object
interaction. Mastery of these patterns enhances code quality and promotes best practices in software design.
