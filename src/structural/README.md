# Structural Design Patterns

## Overview

Structural Design Patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on the composition of classes and objects to
form larger structures. They provide solutions for building flexible and efficient software architectures by defining
how classes and objects can be combined to create new functionalities.

## Patterns Included

1. Adapter Pattern [ðŸ”—](./adapter)
2. Bridge Pattern [ðŸ”—](./bridge)

## Advantages

- Flexibility: Structural patterns enhance flexibility by promoting the composition of classes and objects, allowing for
  the creation of complex structures.

- Reusability: These patterns encourage the reuse of existing classes and components, leading to more modular and
  maintainable code.

- Clarity: By defining clear relationships and structures between classes and objects, structural patterns improve the
  overall
  organization of software systems.

## Conclusion

Understanding and applying Structural Design Patterns is essential for creating scalable and well-organized software
architectures. These patterns focus on the arrangement and composition of classes, providing solutions for building
robust and adaptable systems.
