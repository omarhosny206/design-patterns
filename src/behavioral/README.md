# Behavioral Design Patterns

## Overview

Behavioral Design Patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on the interaction and communication between
objects. They provide solutions for organizing, managing, and coordinating the responsibilities of objects, enhancing
the flexibility and extensibility of a system.

## Patterns Included

1. Strategy Pattern [ðŸ”—](./strategy)
2. State Pattern [ðŸ”—](./state)
3. Observer Pattern [ðŸ”—](./observer)
4. Chain of Responsibility Pattern [ðŸ”—](./chainofresponsibility)

## Advantages

- Flexibility: Behavioral patterns enhance the flexibility of a system by allowing objects to collaborate in various
  ways, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements.

- Encapsulation: These patterns encapsulate algorithms, behaviors, or communication strategies, ensuring that the
  details are abstracted from the client code.

- Reusability: By promoting a clear separation of concerns, behavioral patterns contribute to code reuse and
  maintainability.

## Conclusion

Understanding and applying Behavioral Design Patterns is crucial for designing systems that are adaptable, extensible,
and well-organized. These patterns focus on defining the interactions between objects, providing solutions for effective
communication and collaboration.
