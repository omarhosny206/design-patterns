# Factory Design Pattern

## Overview

The Factory Design Patterns are creational design patterns that provide an interface for creating objects in a
superclass, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. They help in promoting loose
coupling, flexibility, and extensibility in your code.

## Implementations

1. Factory Method [ðŸ”—](./factorymethod)

2. Simple Factory [ðŸ”—](./simplefactory)
